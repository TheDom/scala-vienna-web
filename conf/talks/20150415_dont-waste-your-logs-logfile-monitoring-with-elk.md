The ELK stack consists of [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) (realtime search cluster based on Apache Lucene), [Logstash](http://logstash.net/) (logfile aggregation), and [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) (HTML5 app to visualize JSON data) and can be used to bring astonishing insights in your collected log data. It does not matter where the log informations are from. Don't waste your logfiles and help your Dev and Ops team to better collaborate on logfile analysis.
