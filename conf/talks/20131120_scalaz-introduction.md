Some of the less wacky bits about Scalaz. :)

#### Heiko's article on Typeclasses / Type-safe equality: #### 
<http://hseeberger.github.io/blog/2013/05/30/implicits-unchained-type-safe-equality-part1/>

Here's I think a really good article on Monoids. The author uses F#, but it's still easy to understand the code and the concepts/ideas are the same anyway:

<http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/monoids-part2/>
<http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/monoids-part3/>
(same example in Scala, but not as elaborate as the other article: <http://blog.david-andrzejewski.com/data/word-count-is-a-monoid-homomorphism/>)

#### Learning Scalaz: #### 
This is probably the best tutorial you can find on the Internet for Scalaz at the moment (if you know anything better, let me know ..)
<http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/> 
Syntax-wise sometimes it can be rather difficult to read the code though ... maybe you want to consider reading the source for a lot of that tutorial <http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters>) 

#### Code ####
The code I showed in the end, I posted here:

#### Other Stuff ####
Other stuff I didn't mention but found very useful:
