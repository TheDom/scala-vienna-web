Rea is a language and framework based on the principles of Task-Oriented Programming, in which computations are described as workflows of independent tasks. The aim of Rea is to support programming Cyber-Physical Systems that are collaborating computational elements interacting with their physical environment and controlling physical processes. 
In the lightning talk, I will introduce Rea through a small example, and discuss the issues we face when implementing it in Scala.
